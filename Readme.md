Clone the repository to your local machine
Open the project in Android Studio
Build and run the app on an emulator or physical device

## What areas of the app did you focus on?
The main focus of this project was the Node Listing Screen, which lists nodes with relevant data such as public key, alias, channels, capacity, first seen date, and city/country information.

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?
The challenge's main objective was to implement a simple, functional screen to display nodes efficiently. I concentrated on making the UI straightforward, with clear labeling for each data point, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## How long did you spend on this project?
I spent approximately 3 hours and 40 minutes on this project.

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
The focus of the challenge was relatively simple, but if I had more time, I would have focused on:

Security: Configuring R6 (and other security protocols) to make the app production-ready.

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
The weakest part of the project would likely be Security. In this challenge, I did not focus on security aspects such as authentication, data encryption, or secure communication. These would be essential for any real-world application, and I would prioritize them in a production environment.

## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?
